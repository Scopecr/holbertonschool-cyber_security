## Introduction
Web hacking involves exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for securing web applications.

## Common Web Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection
SQL Injection occurs when an attacker manipulates a SQL query through user input, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL code on the database.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing cookies or session tokens.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CSRF tricks a user into performing actions on a web application without their consent, using their authenticated session.

### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
IDOR occurs when an application exposes internal objects to users, allowing them to access unauthorized data.

## Security Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize user inputs.
- Use prepared statements for database queries.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Regularly update and patch software.
- Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

## Tools and Resources
- cURL
- SQLMap

## Conclusion
Understanding web hacking fundamentals is essential for protecting web applications from malicious attacks. By following security best practices and utilizing the right tools, you can significantly enhance the security of your web applications.
