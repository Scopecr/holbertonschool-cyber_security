10114,CVE-1999-0524,2.1,Low,ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure,It is possible to determine the exact time set on the remote host.,The remote host answers to an ICMP timestamp request. This allows an attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine which may assist an unauthenticated remote attacker in defeating time-based authentication protocols. Timestamps returned from machines running Windows Vista / 7 / 2008 / 2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect but usually within 1000 seconds of the actual system time.,Filter out the ICMP timestamp requests (13) and the outgoing ICMP timestamp replies (14).,
53514,CVE-2011-0657,10.0,Critical,MS11-030: Vulnerability in DNS Resolution Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2509553) (remote check),Arbitrary code can be executed on the remote host through the installed Windows DNS client.,A flaw in the way the installed Windows DNS client processes Link-local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) queries can be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the context of the NetworkService account. Note that Windows XP and 2003 do not support LLMNR and successful exploitation on those platforms requires local access and the ability to run a special application. On Windows Vista 2008 7 and 2008 R2 however the issue can be exploited remotely.,Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows XP 2003 Vista 2008 7 and 2008 R2.,https://www.nessus.org/u?361871b1
57608,,5.0,Medium,SMB Signing not required,Signing is not required on the remote SMB server.,Signing is not required on the remote SMB server. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against the SMB server.,Enforce message signing in the host's configuration. On Windows this is found in the policy setting 'Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)'. On Samba the setting is called 'server signing'.,http://www.nessus.org/u?df39b8b3,http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731957.aspx,http://www.nessus.org/u?74b80723,https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html,http://www.nessus.org/u?a3cac4ea
90510,CVE-2016-0128,5.8,Medium,MS16-047: Security Update for SAM and LSAD Remote Protocols (3148527) (Badlock) (uncredentialed check),The remote Windows host is affected by an elevation of privilege vulnerability.,The remote Windows host is affected by an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Security Account Manager (SAM) and Local Security Authority (Domain Policy) (LSAD) protocols due to improper authentication level negotiation over Remote Procedure Call (RPC) channels. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to intercept communications between a client and a server hosting a SAM database can exploit this to force the authentication level to downgrade allowing the attacker to impersonate an authenticated user and access the SAM database.,Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows Vista 2008 7 2008 R2 2012 8.1 RT 8.1 2012 R2 and 10.,http://www.nessus.org/u?52ade1e9,http://badlock.org/
97833,CVE-2017-0143,9.3,High,MS17-010: Security Update for Microsoft Windows SMB Server (4013389) (ETERNALBLUE) (ETERNALCHAMPION) (ETERNALROMANCE) (ETERNALSYNERGY) (WannaCry) (EternalRocks) (Petya) (uncredentialed check),The remote Windows host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.,The remote Windows host is affected by multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) due to improper handling of certain requests. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities via a specially crafted packet to execute arbitrary code. An information disclosure vulnerability also exists due to improper handling of certain requests. ETERNALBLUE ETERNALCHAMPION ETERNALROMANCE and ETERNALSYNERGY are exploits disclosed by the Shadow Brokers. WannaCry/WannaCrypt and EternalRocks are ransomware and worm programs utilizing these exploits. Petya spreads via ETERNALBLUE.,Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows Vista 2008 7 2008 R2 2012 8.1 RT 8.1 2012 R2 10 and 2016.
