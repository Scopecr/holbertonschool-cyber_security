# OWASP Top 10 Practice

This repository contains exercises and examples to help you understand and practice the OWASP Top 10 security risks for web applications. The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**
5. **Broken Access Control**
6. **Security Misconfiguration**
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
8. **Insecure Deserialization**
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
